        <h1>Necklace</h1>
        <p>This necklace was created by both of the stores owners. Forged by Ant and magically infused by Nora, this necklace was one of their favorite collaborations. When worn, the necklace can be used to change the wearers clothing colors and style. This necklace is a great addition to costumes and ordinary clothing alike.</p>
