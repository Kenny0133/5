        <h1>Smoke Detector</h1>
        <p>This item was created by one of the stores owners during a magical incident within the store. So far, ten of these smoke detectors have been created and three of them used. When lit, these items create trails of smoke that lead the burners to desired locations. Beware however, when lit the smoke trail led the owner to a cursed item that changed the way they tasted food for six weeks. </p>
        <p>Price:15 G</p>
