    <h1>Magic Orb</h1>
<p>This magical orb was created thousands of years ago by a witch whose name has been forgotten. Users have said that the orb has been known to work at random, showing predictions of peoples futures. Interestingly enough, the predictions have been said to be color coordinated. White tells of fortune, blue tells of impending sadness, and black foretells of doom closing in. Many other colors have been seen but aren't as well documented with this orb.</p>
