<h1>Creature Deck</h1>
<p>This card deck is not like any other. The owners found the deck within an abandoned crypt. Suprisingly enough, when the cards are used, they shapeshift into tiny paper creatures. These paper creatures can be used to do small tasks and will reappear in the deck if they get destroyed. The creature type is random and only lasts for about ten minutes, but nonetheless have been very helpful when the owners have used them.</p>
